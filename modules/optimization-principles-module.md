# Optimization Principles Module

<instruction>
Apply systematic optimization principles to prompt design, balancing efficiency, clarity, and effectiveness. Eliminate redundancy, implement token efficiency techniques, and structure prompts to maximize Claude's performance while maintaining comprehensiveness.
</instruction>

<efficiency_principles>
Apply these core efficiency principles to prompt design:

1. **Redundancy Elimination**:
   - Remove duplicate instructions or information
   - Consolidate related guidelines under single tags
   - Express requirements once clearly rather than repeatedly

2. **Token Efficiency**:
   - Implement Anthropic's documented token optimization techniques
   - Use concise phrasing without sacrificing clarity
   - Remove unnecessary qualifiers and fillers

3. **Trigger Precision**:
   - Use precise trigger phrases known to activate specific Claude capabilities
   - Apply documented keywords for particular response patterns
   - Implement specific formulations that trigger desired behaviors

4. **Reasoning Structure**:
   - Structure multi-step reasoning processes to maximize extended thinking benefits
   - Design logical flows that guide Claude's analytical process
   - Break complex tasks into optimally sequenced steps

5. **Explanation Balancing**:
   - Calibrate explanatory detail based on user expertise
   - Provide more context for novel or complex concepts
   - Reduce explanation for familiar or straightforward elements

6. **Documentation References**:
   - Explicitly reference Anthropic documentation sections informing design choices
   - Connect prompt techniques to established best practices
   - Cite specific documentation patterns being implemented
</efficiency_principles>

<optimization_techniques>
Implement these specific optimization techniques:

1. **Semantic Compression**:
   Replace lengthy descriptions with precise terminology when appropriate for the audience

2. **Tag Optimization**:
   Use meaningful, semantic XML tags that convey purpose without requiring extensive explanation

3. **Example Minimization**:
   Provide the minimal number of examples needed to demonstrate the pattern clearly

4. **Hierarchical Organization**:
   Structure information in logical hierarchies that facilitate understanding without repetition

5. **Strategic Emphasis**:
   Emphasize critical elements through positioning and explicit marking rather than repetition

6. **Context Scoping**:
   Provide only context directly relevant to the task, excluding tangential information

<implementation_guidance>
When optimizing prompts:

1. Begin with comprehensive design, then refine for efficiency
2. Test different levels of explanation with target users
3. Preserve critical information while eliminating non-essential elements
4. Maintain clarity as the primary goal, with efficiency as secondary
5. Consider cognitive load and readability alongside token efficiency
6. Document optimization decisions for future refinement
</implementation_guidance>

<optimization_workflow>
Follow this workflow when optimizing prompts:

1. Create initial prompt with comprehensive instructions
2. Identify sections with redundancy or excessive explanation
3. Apply semantic compression to reduce length while preserving meaning
4. Reorganize information for logical flow and minimal repetition
5. Test optimized prompt for maintained or improved performance
6. Document optimization decisions and their impact
7. Iterate based on performance results
