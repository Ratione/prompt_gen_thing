   - Version control and change tracking methodologies
</evolution_components>

<evaluation_methods>
Implement these methods for prompt evaluation:

1. **Success Metrics Definition**:
   Establish clear, measurable indicators aligned with prompt objectives

2. **A/B Testing Framework**:
   Compare prompt variants with controlled testing to identify improvements

3. **User Feedback Collection**:
   Gather structured input from end users on prompt performance

4. **Error Analysis Protocol**:
   Systematically categorize and analyze failure modes

5. **Comparative Benchmarking**:
   Evaluate against established baseline or competitor approaches

6. **Longitudinal Performance Tracking**:
   Monitor performance changes over time and across different conditions
</evaluation_methods>

<adaptation_strategies>
Implement these strategies for prompt adaptation:

1. **Modular Component Substitution**:
   Swap specific components while maintaining overall structure

2. **Audience-Based Adjustment**:
   Modify complexity, examples, and terminology for different users

3. **Context Expansion/Contraction**:
   Scale contextual information based on need and familiarity

4. **Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration**:
   Incorporate specialized terminology and frameworks for different fields

5. **Use Case Parameterization**:
   Create variable elements that can be adjusted for different scenarios
</adaptation_strategies>

<refinement_process>
Follow this process for prompt refinement:

1. Start with comprehensive evaluation of current performance
2. Identify specific strengths and weaknesses
3. Prioritize improvements based on impact and effort
4. Implement targeted changes to address priority issues
5. Test revised prompt against original baseline
6. Document changes and their effects
7. Repeat cycle with progressive improvements
</refinement_process>
