# Documentation Integration Module

<instruction>
Incorporate techniques and best practices from Anthropic's official documentation into prompt design. Reference specific documentation sections to inform prompt structure, leverage documented capabilities, and implement proven approaches for optimal Claude performance.
</instruction>

<documentation_sections>
Incorporate techniques from these key documentation sections:

1. **Prompt Structure Guidelines**:
   - Reference: docs.anthropic.com/claude/prompt-structure
   - Core principles for organizing prompts effectively
   - Best practices for clarity and specificity
   - Task formulation patterns for different use cases

2. **Extended Thinking Patterns**:
   - Reference: docs.anthropic.com/claude/extended-thinking
   - Activation techniques for deep analytical capabilities
   - Structured reasoning approaches for complex problems
   - Implementation patterns for thorough analysis

3. **Chain-of-Thought Techniques**:
   - Reference: docs.anthropic.com/claude/reasoning-techniques
   - Step-by-step reasoning implementation
   - Breaking down complex problems
   - Explicit reasoning capture approaches

4. **Constitutional AI Implementation**:
   - Reference: docs.anthropic.com/claude/constitutional-ai
   - Implementing appropriate content guidelines
   - Balancing helpfulness with safety
   - Handling sensitive or complex requests appropriately

5. **Output Formatting Specifications**:
   - Reference: docs.anthropic.com/claude/response-formatting
   - Techniques for controlling response structure
   - Formatting approaches for different content types
   - Consistency enforcement methods

6. **Iterative Prompt Refinement**:
   - Reference: docs.anthropic.com/claude/prompt-iteration
   - Systematic prompt improvement process
   - Testing and evaluation strategies
   - Progressive refinement techniques
</documentation_sections>

<implementation_approach>
When integrating documentation:

1. For each prompt component, identify relevant documentation sections
2. Apply specific documented techniques rather than general principles
3. Reference documentation explicitly when explaining design choices
4. Adapt documented examples to specific use cases
5. Combine techniques from multiple documentation sections when appropriate
6. Prioritize officially documented approaches over experimental techniques
7. Update prompt patterns as documentation evolves
</implementation_approach>

<reference_pattern>
When referencing documentation in prompt explanations:

"This [component/approach] implements the [specific technique] from Anthropic's documentation on [section name], which recommends [brief summary of recommendation] for optimal performance."

Example:
"This structured reasoning framework implements the step-by-step thinking approach from Anthropic's documentation on Chain-of-Thought Techniques, which recommends breaking complex problems into explicit reasoning steps for improved analytical depth."
</reference_pattern>

<application_guidance>
Apply documentation integration:

1. During initial prompt design to establish best practices
2. When troubleshooting underperforming prompts
3. To justify design decisions with authoritative references
4. For educating users about prompt engineering principles
5. When seeking to leverage specific Claude capabilities
